# Shiny_app_Acomys

This repository contains the shiny app that I created to aid in the data visualization for my minor research project at the Karolinska institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. The shiny app constitutes a multi-tab and multi-page web application which displays the (episodic) diversifying selection results from HyPhy aBSREL and HyPhy MEME for each analyzed gene and each codon position, respectively. 

Furthermore, many other calculated parameters from the evolutionary models and the likelyhood ratio tests are also displayed by the shiny app.
